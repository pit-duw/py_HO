Before installing Helac-Onia you need to install LHAPDF by typing the follwong commands into your terminal (make sure to change the prefix to the path where you want to install LHAPDF):

wget https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/downloads/?f=LHAPDF-6.2.0.tar.gz -O LHAPDF-6.2.0.tar.gz
tar xf LHAPDF-6.2.0.tar.gz
cd LHAPDF-6.2.0
./configure --prefix=/path/for/installation             # example: --prefix=/local0/p_duwe01/LHAPDF
make
make install

You will have to add the installation prefix it to your systems PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH (see note at bottom if you don't know what this means). You can check whether your installation was successful via 

lhapdf-config

By default LHAPDF does not include any PDF sets. Download the ones you need from https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/pdfsets.html . Go to your downloads folder and unpack them and copy them to the LHAPDF directory via 

tar xf PDF_NAME.tar.gz
cp -r PDF_NAME /path/for/installation/LHAPDF/share/LHAPDF

You can check whether it was successful by looking at the list of your currently installed PDFs 

lhapdf list --installed



Now you can install Helac-Onia:

wget http://helac-phegas.web.cern.ch/helac-phegas/tar-files/HELAC-Onia-2.0.1.tar.gz -O HO.tar.gz
tar xf HO.tar.gz

Step 1: Enter the HO/inputs folder and open the file ho_configuration.txt and remove the "#" at the start of the line 
# lhapdf = lhapdf-config
and replace "lhapdf-config" by 
/path/for/installation/LHAPDF/bin/lhapdf-config

Step 2: Open the files Colliders_PSI1.f90 and Colliders_PSI2.f90 in the src folder and search for any occurence of 
STOP" 
then replace by 
STOP " 
Otherwise it might not compile (depends on the exact version of your fortran compiler)

Step 3: Open the terminal in the helaconia folder and type 
./config 
Step 4: Once the configuration is done type 
make
Step 5: Helac-Onia should now be ready. You can check by typing 
./cluster/bin/ho_cluster

You can then calculate the cross section with the default settings by typing
generate addon 3
launch

This should take less than two minutes and create a folder PROC_HO_X (where X starts at 0 and increses whenever you launch a new calculation). This folder contains a subfolder P0_addon_fit_pp_psiX_CrystalBall/outputs with a gnuplot script (fit_results.gnu) you can run to plot the results (creates a fit_results.ps file)

Setting PATHs:
The simplest way to do this is opening the bash_rc file in a text editor (nano is the terminal editor existing on every linux device, you can use gedit or something if you want a GUI texteditor. Also note that bash_rc might be called bashrc or bash_profile on your computer):

nano ~/.bash_rc

scroll down to the last line of the file and add 

export PATH=/path/for/installation/LHAPDF/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/for/installation/LHAPDF/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=/path/for/installation/LHAPDF/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

Then press
[ctrl]-o [Enter] [ctrl]-x
to save the file. MAKE SURE TO CLOSE AND REOPEN YOUR TERMINAL AFTER UPDATING BASH_RC OTHERWISE THE CHANGES WILL NOT APPLY.
