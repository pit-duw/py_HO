This is a list of changes to HELAC-Onia since January 2013:

Version 1.1.X
=================

29/01/2013: - 1) Add a line "nogo=0" in the subroutine Helac_checki0 of Helac_master.f90, so that it works well also for GNU gfortran 4.6.3 or higher (thanks to Carol). 2) Remove some warnings in compilation.

31/01/2013: - 1) Remove some redundant comments. 2) Add README and CHANGES files. 3) Remove two useless files,i.e. Main_Program.f90 and Recursive_PSI.f90.
