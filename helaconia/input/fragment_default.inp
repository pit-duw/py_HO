# FRAGMENT CHANNELS
# The syntax is
# Fragment Chain I
# 1
# ID_parton PDG_h
# OR
# Fragment Chain I
# 2
# index_parton PDG_h
# where I = 1,...,99, ID_parton is the HELAC-Onia ID for the fragmenting parton, index_parton is the index final number parton, PDG_h is the PDG for the fragmented hadron, 1/2 after closingly "Fragment Chain I" line is the Type.
# Example of syntax:
# g >> pi0: 
# In type 1:
# Fragment Chain 1
# 1
# 35 111
# First final parton fragments to pi0:
# In type 2:
# Fragment Chain 1
# 2
# 1 111
